    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The way of Bel Canto singing originated in Italy and was passed on by legends such as Enrico Caruso, Beniamino Gigli, and Luciano Pavarotti. Singing that is effortless in the throat, yet demanding of the body—loud, articulate, emotional, and truly expressive.</p>
    <p>This rare and refined skill requires passion, patience, and uncompromising devotion. Here, you’ll find a path of self-discovery with guidance from a coach who listens deeply and understands the voice with precision.</p>

        <p><strong>I'm Serge.</strong> My journey began at 14 in church choirs and later continued with private training from professional opera singers in Russia and Australia. I’ve avoided formal musical education, instead learning only from trusted masters.</p>
        <p>From Valeriya Ilynichna Skirda, I learned the deep breath technique, relaxed throat, and vocal resonance. Antonio Maria Lancuba taught me the true art of bel canto and introduced me to Caruso’s Gold Standard of the male voice.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Technique</h2>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
      <li><strong>Larynx in low position:</strong> Always keep the larynx low, especially on high notes. Support from below—never lift the neck or strain.</li>
      <li><strong>Breath support:</strong> True support comes from low in the body. The vocal cords should feel no pressure at all.</li>
      <li><strong>Chest as a pedal:</strong> The chest moves, not the abdomen. This ensures a smooth and consistent air column.</li>
      <li><strong>The ‘U’ vowel:</strong> The ‘U’ sound naturally relaxes and opens the throat. It is both powerful and sustainable.</li>
      <li><strong>Open throat:</strong> Pressure should never reach the cords. Keep the throat open by targeting air pressure below the larynx.</li>
      <li><strong>Lower jaw:</strong> Keep it neutral or slightly forward. This opens the vocal space and supports projection.</li>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">FAQ</h2>
    <div class="space-y-4">
      <p><strong>Are there different types of singing?</strong> From the classical perspective, only one: true singing with breath and resonance. Others may produce sound, but not with the same physical or artistic principles.</p>
      <p><strong>Why does opera sometimes sound unpleasant?</strong> Poor technique or imitation often leads to throaty, unclear sound. True opera singing should be clear, beautiful, and emotional.</p>
      <p><strong>Is body weight important for singing?</strong> Not necessarily. Great voices come in many forms. Technique, breath, and muscle engagement matter far more than size.</p>
